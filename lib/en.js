    "summary": "**Hello everyone !**  \n  \n**Fascinated by manual tasks as well as new technologies, my background is indeed unorthodox**. After obtaining my economic and social high school diploma (US) - A levels (UK), I entered the IUT of Nice Sophia-Antipolis in the IT department. **Having finished second of the promotion**, this training was my gateway to access the engineering schools. I therefore joined INSA Lyon after my two-year technical degree in Computer Science. Loving Germany and not wanting to stop there, **I made the choice to carry out a double degree with the University of Passau**. **I'm curious by nature and like to understand how everything works and from where everything comes**. Thanks to internet I can find the response of all my questions, that improve my overall of everything understanding. I am someone who loves to find solutions to problems.  \n  \n**Now that the introductions are made, I am Anthony FARAUT, having a double degree in computer science in France and Germany**. I like playing with unstructured data, big data, machine learning, automatons and websites. **I am currently looking for a job abroad and I am open to any new challenge.**",
